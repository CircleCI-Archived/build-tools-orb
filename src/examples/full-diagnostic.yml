  # this example uses the machine executor; these orb commands
  # should work in any Debian- or Ubuntu-based environment
  executors:
    machine:
      machine: true

  jobs:
    build:
      executor: machine
      steps:
        - checkout
        # rest of your build steps

    deploy:
      executor: machine
      steps:
        - checkout
        # rest of your deploy steps

  workflows:
    build-and-deploy:
      jobs:
        - build:
            pre-steps:
              - build-tools/env-info
              - build-tools/memory
              - build-tools/test-results
            post-steps:
              - build-tools/store-report
